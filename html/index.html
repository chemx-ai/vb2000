<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>the only time they have ever meet in person.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6>What is new in version 2.8?</FONT></P>

The VB2000 2.8 release is primarily due to developments in the GAMESS version that are outlined below, 
marked with <B>GAMESS</B> but some changes are more general.<P>

• A *.vec file can be created containing a GAMESS like $VEC file for initial orbitals. MOs, LMOs and 
final VB orbitals. This is now supported by MacMolPlt which labels the  orbitals correctly</P>
      
• Molden files can now be read directly by the stand-alone version, to use the basis set, geometry 
and  MOs directly from another program.</P>
      
• VB2000 can now use the structures for a set of ionicities (number of double occupied orbitals) 
or, equivalently, seniority number (number of singly occupied orbitals).</P>
      
• <B>GAMESS - </B> The Generalized Product Function Energy Partitioning code from the Nascimanto Group in Brazil 
was added.</P>

• <B>GAMESS - </B> The VB2000 2.8 release is primarily due to developments that removes restrictions on the kind 
of GAMESS calculation that are used to construct initial guess orbitals in VB2000. Now all values of SCFTYP 
can be used, allowing UHF, GVB and MCSCF orbitals, in addition to RHF and ROHF. All kinds of DFT orbitals 
can be used. MP2, coupled-cluster and configuration interaction can be calculated but the HF orbitals 
are used. GVB is restricted to closed shell and uses the actual “bond” GVB orbitals after using localized 
orbitals to calculate the GVB CI pairs. The GVB orbitals can be a particularly good initial guess to 
use VB2000 for more advanced VB methods than GVB-PP. RUNTYP = OPTIMIZE and RUNTYP = HESSIAN can now 
be used to optimize the geometry or calculate frequencies with the GAMESS method before doing a VB2000 
calculation, as well as optimizing the geometry or calculate frequencies with the VB method. RUNTYP = IRC
and RUNTYP = SURFACE can be used with a range of GAMESS methods, calculating VB function at each point.  
$GMSPATH/vb2000/docs/Readme-2.8-tests, explains these methods in more
detail and describes a set of test files for them.</P>
      
• <B>GAMESS - </B> VB calculations can be done after a optimisation or Hessian with another method or along 
an IRC or set of saddle points calculate with another method. </P>
 
• See the CHANGELOG and  Change_VB2.7-2.8.pdf in the DOC directory for more details and for 
other developments.</P>
