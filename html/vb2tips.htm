VB2000, Version 2.7, was released in 2013, and included in GAMESS(US) in 2014. 
Version 2.7 is still in the GAMESS(US) release, but the stand-alone version 
2.8 is about to be released, with hopefully the GAMESS version to follow 
closely after. 

<P>The purpose of this page is to collect together everything we, the 
authors, and the VB2000 community have learnt about using the program.
However, the current version is just a start.</P>

<h3><font color="#3333ff">Tips and tricks</font></h3> 
<P> The following advice may help you to run VB2000
more effectively for your systems.  
<OL> 

<LI> If you want to run a multi-group VB calculation, specify the VB
groups explicitly using the "dot" notation, such as
VB(8).CASVB(6,6).VB(8). You can specify the same kind of calculation by
using GPF(ng) and other controls, but the "dot"  notation is much
easier to use and intuitive.

<LI> You can do a VB calculation of a molecule at one geometry and do
another VB calculation on the same molecule at a different geometry by
reading the VB orbitals of a previous calculation. This is not only a
good way to speed up convergence of a new calculation, but also a
necessary step for generating initial VB orbitals for a bond breaking
calculation in some cases.

<LI> If a VB group has many resonance structures and you have difficulty
to determine which ones make major contributions, you can try a CASVB
calculation first and then check the biggest contributors.

<LI> Try to avoid running CASVB or SCVB for groups with large number of
electrons (N>8 for CASVB and N>12 for SCVB - but SC(12,m) with m say 11
or 13 is more challenging). If you want to run SCVB(n) (n slightly larger 
than 12), you can try to run a VB(n) for orbital optimization with one or a
few structures, and then do a SCVB(n) as a restart calculation without
further optimization of VB orbitals (using key word CIONLY).

<LI> The spin-density calculation can be very time consuming for group
with more than 12 electrons.

<LI> If VBSCF for VB orbital optimization becomes unstable, you can turn
on DIIS.  See Chapter 6 for more details about key word DIIS. The DIIS
option helps to maintain the symmetry of wave function during VBSCF
iterations.

<LI> If the macro iteration is unstable (total energy becomes
oscillating, you can set a damping factor for rigid rotation. See
Chapter 6 for control $DAMPROT.

<h3><font color="#3333ff">VB2000 on 64bit processors.</font></h3>
<UL>
<LI>All tests are using only one processor. The VB2000 codes do not support
parallel processing.<P>
<LI>The Gamess/VB2000 version and the stand-alone version work fine with the 
gfortran and intel compilers.<P> 
<LI>We have used earlier versions VB2000 on Itanium 64 bit machine, on a SGI Irix,
and on intel 64 bit processors with the Gamess TARGET=linux64 
(using the g95 and pgf77 compilers). Thanks are due to Jörg
Saßmannshausen, Institut für Chemische Technologie von Materialien. TU-Graz, 
Austria (now in London) for allowing access to his machines for one of these tests.<P>
<LI>We have tested both Gaussian03 and Gaussian09 on intel 64 bit processors
at the <A HREF="http://nf.apac.edu.au/">Australian National Facility</A>.
Particular thanks are due to Rika Kobayashii, as Gaussian09 involves
changes in the interface with VB2000.  No such changes were involved in
moving from Gaussian98 to Gaussian03.  These Gaussian versions, where the
VB2000 code is a separate Gaussian mode, is no longer supported.<P>
</UL>

<h3><font color="#3333ff">New VB2000/Gaussian version.</font></h3> 

<P>From Gaussian09D1, where a large file of integrals and other values can
be output, there is a stand-alone VB2000 Gaussian version that reads that
file. There is no longer the problem of compiling VB2000 into Gaussian
when most users do not have the source code. This version however is more
limited than the earlier built-in Gaussian VB2000 versions. The large
file in more recent versions of Gaussian now contains more material, such
as dipole moment integrals. However the Gaussian VB2000 version does not 
yet allow these output files from more recent versions of Gaussian. It
is getting to the top of my TODO list.

<h3><font color="#3333ff">Geometry optimization.</font></h3>
Geometry optimization with VB2000 is possible in two ways:-
<OL>
<LI>Using Gamess/VB2000 with the TRUDGE facility.
<LI>Using Gamess/VB2000 with numerical gradients.
</OL>
Problems arise because VB2000 does not use symmetry. Method 2 can only use 
symmetry for reading in the data. It then has to switch off symmetry. 
Method 1 can use symmetry as you can define contraints on the variables. 
However the geometry data has to be input using the Hilderbrand internal 
coordinates and these are widely recognised to be a real pain. If you have to 
use Gamess/VB2000 for geometry optimization on symmetric molecules, master 
Hilderbrand internals. This was not made as clear as it could have been in 
earlier documentation. Indeed, we have only recently realised how restrictive 
symmetry is in this respect.

<P><HR>
<h3><font color="#3333ff">Effective core potentials with VB2000.</font></h3>
<P>In case this is not clear from the Gamess/VB2000 test examples, the
use of efffective core potentials is quite straight forward. Any
potential that can be run with Gamess directly can be used with the
Gamess/VB2000 combination.<P>

<P><HR>
<h3><font color="#3333ff">Parallization of VB2000.</font></h3>
First parallization tests are likely to be with the Gamess/VB2000
version but it is still a daunting task. Anyone want to have a crack at
this?
