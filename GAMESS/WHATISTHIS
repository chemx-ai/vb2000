This gamess directory contains material that you might want to add
to the gamess/vb2000 that you will get if you install GAMESS. VB2000
is included by default in GAMESS. Alternatively, it will give you some
idea of VB2000 in GAMESS before you install GAMESS.

"checkvb" is a script very like the "install" script for the stand-alone
VB2000 or the "compvb" script in the VB2000/g09-vb2000-release directory.
it compiles the VB2000 source files, vb2gau-so.src and vb2000.src (the
latter after activating the CGMS lines). To run this script from here,
you need to alter the line:-

setenv VB_DIR ../../VB2000/SRC

near the top of the script to:

setenv VB_DIR ../SRC

as the source codes are in VB2000/SRC.

"gamess.README" tells you why you might want to get GAMESS/VB2000 and
other stuff.

"EPFEP_DOCUMENTATION.pdf" tells you about the Generalized Product Function
Energy Partitioning (GPF-EP) from the Nascimento Group in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, that is now in VB2000/GAMESS.

"GMS_VB_test.README" tells you about the tests for VB2000/GAMESS.
