The documentation has grown over the years, and we would welcome
suggestions for making it better and rationalising it. In spite of its
size, it undoubtably still contains errors and misses some features. If
you find any such cases, please let us know by email to:-

brian.james.duke@gmail.com  

If you are benefiting from using VB2000, please contribute to the project
if only in a small way by doing the above. We also welcome any changes
that you make to the VB2000 code or any changes you would like us to
consider.

Thanks.
