ChangeLog for VB2000 since inclusion in GAMESS(US).
---------------------------------------------------

This directory is the release of VB2000 that is now distributed with
GAMESS(US). Here is recorded all major changes to this release since 
the first time this was sent to the GAMESS group.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 Feb 2012	Sent to GAMESS group
26 Mar 2012	Changed runallvb to reflect new rungms and gms-files.csh.
		Updated README files.
		New code that gives even less ftnchek warning.
30 July 2013 	VB2000 now handles h and i basis functions.
		New $DENSCUBE directive that creates CUBE files for the
		total density, the density of the HF or a VB group, or 
		the spin density if there are unpaired electrons.
		General tidying up of maximum bounds for arrays.
Aug-Sept 2013	Scope of VBOLIB increased by creating LIBs on the fly
		for addition of polarisation and diffuse functions to
		basis sets 3-21, 6-31G and 6-311G. This significantly
		decreases the number of VBOLIBs that are needed, while
		also increasing the number of basis sets covered 
		particularly in the GAMESS version.
		Modified BRILLMASK to create conditions on the fly for
		the simple case of localisation to atoms.
		Some routines not used in GAMESS version moved out of
		vb2000.src.
		Added VBOLIB for MIDI basis set which is different from
		the MIDIX (MIDI!) basis set in the stand-alone version.
		The CENTROID code now calculates the distances of the
		centroids from up to 5 atoms, the first 5 by default or
		by specifying the atoms in the $CENTROID option.
Oct 2013	Visualisation option $VECONLY added to output only the
		$VEC block of VB orbitals for MacMolPlt.
Nov 2013	Fixed bug in VBHESS that occurs only for non-linux
		targets, so allowing use of all GAMESS targets..
		A new visualization directive $DENSCUBE creates CUBE 
		file for the total density, the density of specific 
		groups and, for open shell systems, the spin density. 
		Since both GAMESS and Gaussian with conventional 
		integral storage have both been extended to use h and 
		I basis functions, VB2000 has been extended in this way. 
		However SPHER can not be used with such basis sets and 
		and a bug in Gaussian (fixed for the next release) 
		prevents the use g, h and i with Cartesian basis sets.
2014/2015 	The vb2blas.src file has been renamed to vb2000-so.src 
		and it now contains routines, previously in vb2000.src,  
		that are only used in the stand-alone version. 
		Greater control over maximum values for many parameters 
		has been introduced.
		Visualisation options $VECMOS, $VECLMOS and $VECINIT
		added for. respectively, visualisation of MOs, LMOs
		and intial guess in MacMolPlt.
		Allows post-HF methods such as MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T), CISD,
		as well as CASSCF and GVB, prior to a VB2000 run.
		A geometry optimisation can now be done with all GAMESS
		methods followed by a single-point VB run at the optimised
		geometry Similarly, a Hessian can be calculated prior to a
		single-point VB run. Both this and the geometry
		optimisation are in addition to doing VB2000 geometry
		optimisations and Hessian.
		The overlap matrix S over the initial guess VB orbitals
		and the final VB orbitals are printed along with the
		eigenvalues of S. The Inverse Overlap Weights by Gallup
		and Norbeck are now reported along with three other weights 
		in earlier versions.
		The GAMESS directive AIMPAC=.TRUE. can now give data for
		the VB function. It also has an option to print the
		natural orbitals of the VB function. A matrix is now 
		printed for distances between the centroids.
		Directives are now checked and possible spelling errors
		reported. More checking of directives is done in
		EXETYP=CHECK runs.
Feb 2016        A rapid exit occurs if NaN is reported for the VB energy
		in any nacroiteration.
		For cases where there are several VB2000 entries, such as
		optimisations and Hessian runs, each entry after the first
		now gets its initial guess from the previous run.
		All directives that give a file of orbitals in the GAMESS
		$VEC format now put the the $VEC groups in the same *.vec
		file. The previously undocumented directives $VECINIT,
		$VECMOS, $VECLMOS and $VECONLY that give $VEC groups for
		the MOs in VB2000, the localised orbitals, the initial
		guess and the final VB orbitals respectively, now put the
		$VEC groups into the same *.vec file rather than separate
		files. Similarly runs that do more than one VB calculation,
		and this can give several $VEC groups, now also put the
		$VEC groups into the same *.vec file. The line above the
		$VEC line is specific to the type of orbitals included and
		should never be altered as it is recognised by MacMolPlt
		to identify the orbitals when the $VEC group is imported.
		Many thanks to Brett Bode, the author of MacMolPlt, for
		this splendid collaboration. VB saddle points can now be
		obtained starting from a HF saddle point, using OPT=SADPOINT
		and of course VB2000 calculations can be run at HF saddle
		points geometries. Internal reaction coordinate (IRC) runs
		can now be run, doing a VB2000 calculation at each point.
		These are not VB IRC paths, but paths for the method used
		in GAMESS. Only RHF IRC paths have been studied so far.
		New examples, exam-vb37 and exam-vb38 cover the above two
		new additions.
March 2016      Surface scans can now be done, where a VB calculation is
		added at each point. A new examples, exam-vb39 covers
		this.
April 2016      The $NEWLIB directive has been introduced to use a VBOLIB
		different (a sub set) from the one for the basis set that
		is used.
May 2016        Molden files can now be read directly by the stand-alone
		version, to use the basis set, geometry and  MOs directly
		from another program. GAMESS can not do this, but a small
		program called molden2gmsvb.f reads a Molden file and
		creates a GAMESS VB2000 input file that has the geometry
		basis set from the Molden file, along with a $VEC group
		for the HF orbitals. The calcuation of the HF orbitals in
		GAMESS can be skipped along with the initial guess.
August 2016     VB2000 can now use the structures for a set of ionicities
		or seniority numbers (number of double occupied orbitals
		and number of singly occupied orbitals respectively). These
		are identical interconvertable concepts. This gives a
		number of structures between SC (minimum ionicity or maximum
		seniority number) and CASVB (all possible ionicities or
		seniority numbers).
		All file unit numbers for GAMESS version are now 100 more 
		than they were, so are in the range 180 - 200, avoiding
		any conflict with GAMESS.
September 2016  A major memory allocation bug was found and fixed in 
		vb2000.src in code for the VB2000/GaussianD1 version.
December 2016	The Generalized Product Function Energy Partitioning
		code from the Nascimanto Group in Brazil was added 
		to the GAMESS/VB2000 version.
December 2017	The program was fixed for release under the GPL license.
		The license was added to all source files. Rumer
		structures checked for repeats.
January 2018    vb2000-so.src FUNCTION DNRM2 replaced by LAPACK version
		to remove warnings about ASSIGNED GOTOs and some unused
		declarations removed. Listing option for VBOLIB extended
		to all versions.
April 2018	Added 2 digits to BOHR conversion factor for total 
		comptability with GAMESS.
June 2018	Removed license related lines commented out with CLIC.
		Added output of eigenvalues of overlap matrix over VB
		structures with $PRINTHS directive.
		Changed the Generalized Product Function Energy	Partitioning - 
		GPF-EP method for David de Souxa's version 0.6.1.
July 2018	vbqa.pl to check test results for stand-alone version only
		now allows a parameter for the directory that holds the
		*.out files. Default is TEMPOUT if no parameter.
